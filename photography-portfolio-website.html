  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    The still image embraces a moment and offers it again,
    holding a memory to be cherished and shared. The fondness
    found in exchanged glances. The giddy excitement of a bride-to-be. T
    he delicate peace of a newborn as it sleeps. Through photographs,
    We weave together a narrative of what is most treasured and true.
